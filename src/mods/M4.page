### Description:

 * 6 ECTS

The aim of this course is to acquire good skills in OO software engineering with Java and advanced OO programming in C++.

For the Java based part, the course covers topics on mechanisms of introspection, reflexivity and dynamic loading, and issues related to
the different OO mechanisms (inheritance, composition, constrained genericity). The course then introduces micro-architectures, with the
description and use of several design patterns.

For the C++ part, the course places particular emphasis on the differences in programming style compared to Java, as well as on the
Standard Template Library.
