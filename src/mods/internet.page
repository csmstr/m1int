### Instructor(s)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

The Internet has grown from a research curiosity to something we all
rely on daily. It has been able to withstand rapid growth fairly well
and its core protocols have been robust enough to accommodate numerous
applications that were unforeseen by the original Internet designers.
This lecture will introduce the Internet architecture and the principles
behind it and will highlight the main reasons for the success of the
Internet. We will give a particular attention to the end-to-end, best
effort and network of networks principles. We then explain the basic
Internet protocols across the different layers with a particular focus
on the MAC layer (both wired and wireless), the IP layer and the
transport layer with all its protocols and the challenges it faces in
terms of congestion, flow and error control. We also introduce the
routing issue both intra and inter domains. Over the course we will
point to challenges that has faced and still face the Internet and draw
lines of evolution in an introductory way to the more advanced courses
that will follow (Evolving Internet, Peer-to-Peer Networks, etc).
