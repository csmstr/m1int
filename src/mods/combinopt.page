### Instructor(s)

[Frederic Havet](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Frederic.Havet/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

*Objectives*



This course is an introduction to combinatorial optimization.  It
covers the basic concepts in graph theory and the related fundamental
algorithms:

*    searches in graphs and digraphs: breadth-first search, depth-first search, applications, ...
*    algorithms in edge-weighted graphs: shortest path, minimum-weight spanning tree,...
*    connectivity: k-connectivity, Menger's theorem.
*    matchings: maximum-weight matching, applications,...

We also give a first glimpse to complexity theory (NP-completeness).

This course will be illustrated with many exercises to help the student
to get familiar with graph concepts.
