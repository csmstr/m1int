### Description

* 2 ECTS

Computational complexity theory is concerned by  the amounts of resources required for the execution of algorithms. There are mainly  two  types of complexity: the time complexity of a problem that is number of steps  to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the size of the input (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm, and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the memory used by the algorithm.

This allows to classify computational problems by complexity class such as P ( decision problems that can be solved in an amount of time that is polynomial , NP decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in polynomial time , NP-hard, NP complete. ... ). That will be explained on examples in particular how to reduce a problem to another.
