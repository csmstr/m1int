<br />

### Instructor(s)

[Arnaud Legout](http://planete.inria.fr/alegout/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

Communicating efficiently is a central skill for any modern engineer
and scientist. Indeed, not only it is fundamental to write clearly,
but also to give good talks.

In the first part of this course, we present how to give good talks
from small talks to colleagues to a large audience of hundreds of
attendees. We cover why it is important to give good talks, how to
structure a talk, how to make good slides, how to present slides and
speak in front of an audience, and how to avoid bad surprises.

In the second part of this course, we present how to write technical
and scientific documents from small white papers to international
publications.

This course will be a mix of examples, illustrations of mistakes and
good practices, and hands-on sessions.
