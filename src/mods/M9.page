### Organizer

[Adrien Bousseau](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/)

### Lecturers:
Adrien Bousseau, George Drettakis, Frederic Precioso, Rachid Deriche, Théodore Papadopoulo

### Description:

 * 6 ECTS

This course is divided in 4 parts that cover the basic concepts of computational imagery. Each part is composed of a set of lectures and lab exercises.

 * Image Description and Matching (Frederic Precioso, 12h – 6h lecture and 6h lab): basic image descriptors (pixel, histogram, texture), bio-inspired descriptors (Gabor filters), image matching, image search with applications in medical and satellite imagery.
 * Advanced Computational Image Processing (Rachid Deriche, 12h – 6h lecture and 6h exercises): linear & non-linear image filtering, edge detection and image features, snakes & geodesic active contours via level-set, image enhancements & restoration, segmentation & application to medical imaging.
 * 3D Computer Vision (Théodore Papadopoulo, 12h): camera model, calibration, stereo vision, mosaicing, 3D reconstruction, elements of 3D shape representation.
 * Computer Graphics (Adrien Bousseau, George Drettakis, 18h – 10h lecture and 8h lab): raytracing and rasterization, lighting, texturing, shadows, image-based rendering, OpenGL and GPU programming.

### Grading

The evaluation will be based on three grades:

1. Short exams (10-20 mins) and lab exercises. Short exams in Advanced Computational Image Processing and in 3D Computer Vision, lab exercises in Computer Graphics and in Image Description and Matching.
2. Project. One project in Advanced Computational Image Processing or Computer Graphics. Students with express their preferences over a list of projects and we will assign one project per student.
3. Long exam. One long exam that covers 3D Computer Vision and Image Description and Matching.

### Prerequisites

Basics of programming (C++) and mathematics (linear algebra, geometry)
