### Instructor(s)

[Olivier Dalle](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Olivier.Dalle/wiki/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

This course gives an introduction to protocol engineering. The aim is to
give an overview of the classical idioms and pitfall commonly found when
entering the difficult task of building new protocols. This course is
also an opportunity to introduce a few popular formalisms for studying
protocols, such as Petri Nets and LOTOS. Some related tools, such as CPNTools,
will be experimented on a few use cases during the hands-on lab
sessions.
