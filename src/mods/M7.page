### Description:

 * 6 ECTS

This module combines three courses:
- Models : Persistence and Transformation (lecture=9h, labs=9h)
Instructor: Frédéric Mallet
Embedded systems are characterized by the quick evolution of the underlying execution and development platforms. Therefore, design platforms make a heavy use of transformation or code generation facilities to adapt to this fast evolution. This course discusses some of
modeling technologies frequently used in research platforms for embedded systems, including technologies for the persistence and transformation of models.

- Mobile computing (lecture=6h, labs=6h)
Instructor: Frédéric Mallet
While the war rages over the development of mobile applications through either web or native solutions, this course gives the basics for the development of native Android applications in Java.  

- Advanced Operating Systems (lecture=12h, labs=12h)
Instructor: Sid Touati
This course is devoted to master students willing to understand the kernel of an operating system. While this course is not devoted to a special operating system, we however provide some technical examples with Linux and windows. The course describes some advanced topics on operating systems: threads and process, scheduling, file systems and virtual memory. Laboratory classes are organized under Linux environment.
