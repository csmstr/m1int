### Instructor(s)

[Jean-Charles RÃ©gin](http://www.constraint-programming.com/people/regin/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

The objective of this course is to show that computers may be used for solving exactly complex combinatorial problems, like rostering, bin packing or car sequencing ...

* First, some famous greedy algorithms will be introduced or recalled in order to show their limits, notably that, in general, they do not compute the optimal solution. 
* Then, the exhaustive enumeration will be introduced as a generalisation of greedy algorithms. The students will discover the power of these algorithms but also their main drawback: their exponential complexity.
* At last, some techniques will be introduced to reduce the search space that need to be traversed for solving a problem.

### Prerequisites

* Standard Algorithms (sort, tree traversal, graph algorithms...)
* Standard Data Structures (array, list, heap)

### Others

* Number of lectures (in hrs): 9
* Number of Exercise Classes (in hrs): 9
