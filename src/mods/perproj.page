### Instructor(s)

TBA

### Description

* 6 ECTS

The personal project is done by the student along the whole semester under the supervison of a teacher or researcher. It can be either more research oriented, with a synthesis on a topic, or more programming oriented (implementation).

Alternatively, the personal project can be replaced by a participation to the challenge ["jeunes pousses"](http://www.telecom-valley.fr/cjp) done in a group jointly with students in management schools. At the end a report and a presentaion will be asked.
