# Master 1 International in Computer Science

The international track of the Master 1 in Computer Science is designed for international students. The lectures will be given in English. French speaking students are welcome, provided they have a sufficient level in English.

The Master 1 program corresponds to the first year of Master studies. Upon successful completion of this program, the student will be able to continue in one of the several Master 2 programs offered by the Master 2 IFI of the [University Nice Sophia Antipolis (UNS)](http://www.unice.fr).

The [Master 2 IFI](http://www.unice.fr/asure/dotclear/index.php?2008/03/27/85-master-ii-informatique-fondamentale) offers a lot of tracks in various fields of IT. In particular, two international tracks in English are proposed: [Ubinet (Ubiquitous Networking and Computing)](http://ubinet.inria.fr/) and [CompBio (Computational Biology and Biomedicine)](http://www-sop.inria.fr/websites/campus-stic/msc-computationalbiology/content/presentation.shtml). <!-- Pursuing a second year in another university is also possible. -->

Students of partner universities having an agreement with the University Nice Sophia Antipolis are welcomed and this track can also be validated in their country of origin.

<!-- The first year of the International Master in Computer Science is also designed for students wanting to have a minor in I&E (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), and in particular, for students who will register in the master school of [EIT ICT Labs](http://eit.ictlabs.eu/). -->
