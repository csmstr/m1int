<h2 id="insurance">1. Insurance</h2>

<h3 id="about-obligatory-insurance">About Obligatory insurance?</h3>

<p>You need to take a libility insurance (&ldquo;assurance de responsabilité civile&rdquo;). This is mandatory for you. Keep the paper, it will be asked at the beginning of the internship.</p>

<p>You will be able to take this insurance at BNP Paribas within the housing insurance or alone in other insurance companies.</p>

<h3 id="about-health-insurance">About health insurance?</h3>

<p>Students under 28 are required to take out French student medical insurance, referred to as &ldquo;Sécurité Sociale&rdquo; or &ldquo;Social Security&rdquo;. This entitles the student to a reimbursement of up to 70 % of the standard price of medical expenses incurred. Prescriptions, eyeglasses and dental expenses are subject to different rates. Coverage is included in the student fee. A student can and should also take out a complementary health insurance policy which may reimbourse up to 100% of expenses incurred.</p>

<p>Students who are 28 years old or over are not eligible for coverage under French student social security and are required to have private medical insurance coverage. One possible such insurance for foreign students is http://www.assistance-etudiants.com/en/page/abc. It is of higher importance that you take one private social insurance in this case.</p>

<p>Non-French EU-nationals are exempt from the above if they have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>

<h3 id="about-housing-insurance">About housing insurance?</h3>

<p>You can get housing insurance from BNP Paribas when opening your bank account. Of course, you are free to choose another housing insurance. Please note that you can get proof of housing insurance immediately, as soon as you suscribe it, whereas it will take about one week to get the checkbook and the credit/debit card.</p>

<h2 id="money">2. Money</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-money-should-we-have-when-arriving">How much money should we have when arriving?</h3>

<p>Within the first week after your arrival, you will need to open a bank account. Ecole Polytech has an agreement with the BNP Paribas bank in Sophia Antipolis. It will provide you personal banking services including credit card, cheque book, money transfer and more.</p>

<p>You will need some cash to pay the first month at the residence, the inscription fees and your general expenses. If you don&rsquo;t have a visa or a mastercard to take money here, you will need at least approximately 2,000 euros.</p>

<h3 id="in-order-to-open-a-bank-account-in-france">In order to open a bank account in France.</h3>

<p>We advise you ton open an account in BNP Paribas Sophia Antipolis because Ecole Polytech Nice has some special agreements with them. Opening a bank account there, you can subscribe to a package (liability+housing) insurance.</p>

<p>You should take an appointment by email with:
Mrs Anaik CHAZELAS: anaik.chazelas@bnpparibas.com
BNP Paribas Sophia Antipolis
695 Route des Dolines
06560 Valbonne</p>

<p>The bank is open from monday to friday morning (closed friday afternoon)</p>

<p>8h40 to 13h05  and 14h20 to 17h40</p>

<p>All paperwork should need there is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>une piece d&rsquo;identite en cours de validite [ie., your id or passport],</li>
  <li>l&rsquo;attestation d&rsquo;inscription Polytech [ie., certificate from EPU director given by Lilia Jemmali]</li>
  <li>le bail ou attestation de résidence [certificate from residence giving the address - we will provide you with that]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you go to the bank to open your account, you should obtain immediatly you RIB (=IBAN=Bank references). However, you&rsquo;ll need to wait one week to make some cash deposit and to obtain some means of payment as check and credit card.</p>

<p>You can of course go to another bank if you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-days-it-takes-to-open-a-bank-account-and-use-the-means-of-payment-such-as-credit-card">How many days it takes to open a bank account and use the means of payment such as credit card?</h3>

<p>Usually, it takes some days for BNP Paribas (approximately 1 week) to be allowed to make cash deposit on your bank account, and to provide you means of payment as check and credit cards. They have to check the conformity of the documents you provide them.</p>

<h2 id="arrival">3. Arrival</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-manage-the-telephone-issue">How to manage the telephone issue?</h3>

<p>Bring an unblocked mobile phone to get easily a French phone number, which makes procedures easier and lets you save a lot of money.</p>

<!--###I would also like to know that will the institute will offer or give laptop during the study period to the students?

We need to check that this procedure is possible for year 2010/2011. Inform us as soon as possible if you need a laptop.-->

<h3 id="i-would-like-to-know-that-what-documents-should-i-get-translated-into-french-apart-from-my-birth-certificate-my-passport-and-my-all-transcripts-all-are-in-english-but-my-degree-certificate-is-in-bilingual-form-means-in-english-as-well-as-in-a-regional-language-so-is-it-necessary-to-get-translated-or-originals-in-english-are-enough">I would like to know that What documents should I get translated into French ?Apart from my Birth certificate.

<p>The most important paper to be translated is your birth certificate. Apart from this document, it should be enough to have the diplomas and the transcripts in english.</p>

<p>In order to perform the administrative procedure described herein, you will have to bring the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Passport,</li>
  <li>The acceptance letter to the master,</li>

* Copy of your high school diploma (or equivalent certificate where it says the year you finished secondary
school)
* Copy of your birth document (french translated if possible)</p>

<p>You will need also the “Attestation provisoire d&rsquo;inscription” which will be useful for your first procedures (including to
open your bank account). You can get these documents from Mrs Lilia Jemmali (phone:04 92 96 51 42,
email: jemmali@polytech.unice.fr office 438 at Polytech’Nice Sophia, les Templier, 930 Route des Colles -

<h2 id="travel">4. Travel</h2>

<h3 id="could-anybody-tell-me-how-can-i-get-to-my-residency-when-i-arrive-at-nice-airport">Could anybody tell me how can I get to my residency when I arrive at Nice airport?</h3>

<p>Everything is explained here : http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Joanna.Moulierac/travelinformation.php</p>

<p>In this <a href="http://www.cg06.fr/fr/servir-les-habitants/deplacements/transport-collectifs-tam/lignes-et-horaires/lignes-et-horaires/">page</a> you have all the timetables for the TAM buses (which are the regional ones).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re coming on a working day, the 230 will take you from the airport to the door of the residence in less than one hour. Take into account that some of them pick passengers at terminal 1 and others at &ldquo;airport promenade&rdquo;; this stop is after crossing the Promenade des Anglais (the big avenue going along the airport) using a tunnel next to terminal 1. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101882952717510868710.000001134d95272f6f6eb&amp;ll=43.666344,7.211146&amp;spn=0,359.998258&amp;t=h&amp;z=20&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=43.666368,7.211347&amp;panoid=0n9QQSq9WPHD_uKDN_w2Vg&amp;cbp=12,278.97,,0,10.61">Here</a> you have a google map with all the stops and a close up on the airport promenade stop.</p>

<p>During the weekend, you need to take the bus number 200, asking for &ldquo;correspondance&rdquo; (that allows you to change buses), go down in &ldquo;Passarelle SNCF&rdquo; in the town called Antibes, cross the street and there you take the bus number 1 (Envibus company) and go down on the stop called &ldquo;Georges Pompidou&rdquo;. Warning: many of the buses don&rsquo;t go to Sophia Antipolis, so you should ask the driver or look at the sign in the front. You need the ones that go to Gare Routière Valbonne Sophia-Antipolis (usually abbreviated as gare routiere VSA or such). The timetables for the number 1 are here: http://www.envibus.fr/ligne_detail.asp?id=1&amp;id_commune=10</p>

<h3 id="from-nice-to-sophia">From Nice to Sophia</h3>

<p>It is better to arrive to Nice on weekdays (Monday to Friday). By doing so, you can catch a bus that goes directly to Sophia Antipolis. This bus goes from the Nice Airport Terminal I (note that there is also Airport Terminal II) to Sophia Antipolis. The bus is the number 230, it costs only 1 euro. In 40 minutes you should be arriving to Sophia.</p>

<p>You may get off the bus either at the hotel or at Crous residence. The hotel advised below is at stop Eganaude.</p>

<p>For Crous residence &ldquo;Les Dolines&rdquo;, the point where you get off is pointed out in the basic map as “Pompidou stop” (you will find it next after Gare Routiere VSA in the buses). Ask the driver to stop at Pompidou when getting in the bus, but do not worry, in case you miss that stop, you can step out at the next stop, distances are not big, you can walk back.</p>

<p>On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) or official holidays things will be more complicated. The right way to reach Sophia is going first to Antibes (Piscine bus stop) through bus number 200 (about 30 minutes) or by train (20 minutes). Then you go to Passarelle SNCF to take bus number 1 (Envibus) to Sophia (about 25 minutes). The bus 200 does not go directly through the Airport but it passes really close to it. You should leave the Airport towards Promenade Des Anglais, cross through the tunnel to go to the other side of the route, and then wait here for the bus 200 (still needs to be checked). Note that most buses do not work after 8.30pm. So if you were coming on the weekend it would be better for you to book an hotel in Nice.</p>

<h3 id="going-to-polytech">Going to Polytech</h3>

<p>If you live at Crous residence &ldquo;Les Dolines&rdquo; or in Antibes, then you can use bus Ligne 100 Exp. (Envibus) to go to Polytech. You can get a pass card for the Ligne 100 Exp. bus (company Envibus) by paying only 5 euros for 1 year (it is really cheap, but you can use it only for Ligne 100 Exp.).
If you live in Nice, then you can use the bus 230 (cg06).
Remember: Try to avoid to arrive Sophia Antipolis in weekends because a lot of buses are not working on Saturdays and Sundays except few.</p>

<h3 id="tourism">Tourism</h3>

<p>Eurolignes: Has network all over the europe and prices are quite fair.
Easyjet: No brokerage fees and cheap offers.
SNCF : Only site to buy train tickets.
Eurail : If you want to travel all the Europe Eurail is the best options. they have very nice offers and passes. So just select the passes and travel at very cheap prices.</p>

<p>Nice (bus cg06 230), Antibes (bus envibus 1, 100), Cannes (bus cg06 200, 630), Monaco (bus cg06 100), Menton (bus cg06 100), Grasse (bus 530), Isola 2000 (bus cg06 750)</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-for-the-accomodation">How to do for the accomodation?</h3>

<p>To be update for 2012-2013!!</p>

<p>The (only) on-campus residence for students will be the Crous residence.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can find another solution, with for example the private residence Oxford, Thesa, Saint Exupery or other: http://www.sophia.ensmp.fr/cadre/logements.html</p>

<p>There is also possibilities with colocation : www.colocation.fr/ or www.appartager.com/</p>

<p>Or private flats here : www.seloger.fr</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-possibility-for-financial-housing-support">Is there a possibility for financial housing support?</h3>

<p>As soon as you get final response from OFII to be a legal alien for one year, then you can proceed with applying for a benefit (so-called &ldquo;Aide Pour le Logement&rdquo; - APL). You should get 100 to 150 euros per month if you have a single room, or 60 euros each if you share a room. Please see the bottom of the FAQ.</p>

<h2 id="shopping">6. Shopping</h2>

<p>There is a Carrefour in Antibes that has good prices. To get there catch the bus 100 (Envibus) to bus stop Castors(I). Then walk. The way back is also catching the bus stop Castors(II).
In Nice you can buy from Lydl. Else Casino is also another option to buy.</p>

<p>There are two Asian shops in Antibes (one is near the BNP Paribas bank) where you can buy Asian food. You catch the bus 100 to Place De Gaulle, then walk.</p>

<h2 id="academic-aspects">7. Academic aspects</h2>

<h3 id="will-i-get-a-diploma-after-the-first-year-of-master-m1">Will I get a diploma after the first year of Master M1?</h3>

<p>NO. To get the diploma (degree) of master in France (and in Europe) you should have followed successfully the two years of master. After the first year you will get, if successful, 60ECTS (European credit Transfer system) which are necessary to apply for a second year in Sophia Antipolis or another place in Europe. To get a master in Europe you need 120 ECTS.</p>

<h3 id="is-the-master-m1--m2-considered-as-a-research-master-or-professional-master">Is the master (M1 + M2) considered as a research master&hellip; or professional master?</h3>

<p>This is mostly considered as a research master.</p>

<h3 id="where-i-can-find-some-courses-material-i-can-read-before-the-beginning-of-the-courses">Where I can find some courses material I can read before the beginning of the courses?</h3>

<p>Teachers will indicate to you at your arrival how to get the material for the lectures. For some lectures, bibliographical references or prerequisites are already indicated in the &ldquo;Program&rdquo; section of this website.</p>

<h3 id="when-the-studies-will-begin">When the studies will begin?</h3>

<h2 id="administrative-issues">8. Administrative issues</h2>

<h3 id="when-will-i-receive-the-letters-of-admission-from-the-university">When will I receive the letters of admission from the university?</h3>

<p>The letters will be prepared soon, you will receive them as soon as they are prepared by mail and to your postal address. You will have enough time to prepare the visa for the 1st of october.</p>

<h3 id="for-the-visa-when-i-am-in-france-i-need-to-do-a-medical-check-at-ofii-where-is-it">For the VISA, when I am in France, I need to do a medical check at OFII. Where is it?</h3>

<p>To go to the OFII building (for medical checking) you have to get off at bus stop Santoline (in Nice). Note that not all buses 230 go through that bus stop, so check it before in the timetable, and remember to ask to the bus driver to stop there in advance (even if the bus is supposed to go through Santoline, when nobody asks for this bus stop the bus driver will take a different route, so better ask the bus driver as soon as you get on the bus). From Nice you can catch bus 10 also to go to prefecture.</p>

<!-- ### What is the procedure for the student registration?

 
First, get the “Attestation provisoire d'inscription” which will be useful for your first procedures including to open your bank account.

You can get this document from Mrs Lilia Jemmali (phone:04 92 96 51 42, email: jemmali@polytech.unice.fr office 436) at:
Université de Nice - Sophia Antipolis
Polytech'Nice-Sophia
930 Route des Colles - BP 145
06903 Sophia Antipolis Cedex

    You will do your registration online: http://inscription.unice.fr/ as soon as the web site is available when you arrive.

    go on "Vous êtes étranger"
    click on "Autre cas  - Etudiants étranger admis en L3 en M1 ou M2 : Pour vous inscrire suivez ce lien"
    Then "Choisir sa formation, remplir un dossier et demander un rendez-vous."
    Then "Recherche Par parcours : Master Informatique (IFI)"
    and then "Master 2 Informatique: Fondements et Ingéniérie [ Déposer un dossier et prendre rendez-vous ]" (bottom of the page)

    Then "D'accord, je souhaite déposer maintenant un dossier en Master 2 : Informatique : fondements & ingénierie"

    If you don't have a french diploma (for most of you), in "Personnes françaises ou étrangères titulaires de diplômes étrangers :" you will type "Numéro d'autorisation d'inscription = 9999" and the date of the day you register.
    The list of the students of the master Ubinet has been given to the registration office, so they are aware of the procedure.

    You will get by the end an appointment at office ANTENNE - 205 to complete the registration and get the student card. You will need to bring some papers there.

If you are under 28, you will get medical insurance with your tuition fees (You will have to pay for this). Otherwise, this medical insurance will be provided with Egide.

## 9. Schedule for arrivals on September 2011

Please note the following pieces of information for those who will stay at the CROUS residence "Les Dolines". Those who will not can infer the process they may follow so as to settle in an off-campus residence. PLEASE note the changes in the process (getting simpler):

* Your rooms at the CROUS (Résidence les Dolines - 2400, route des Dolines, 06560 Valbonne-Sophia-Antipolis ) will be available starting from September 20.
* You do not need anymore to go to Crous in Nice. Ignore both the mailed papers you got this summer and the email you got On September 7.
* Then you will be able to go to Dolines IF AND ONLY IF you already have the following documents:

  * proof of housing insurance (obtained from a French insurance company)
  * certificate from the University director (also called acceptance letter from the UFR) sent by Dino Lopez.

At the Dolines, you will have to pay two month rents either by check (from a French bank only) or with a credit card (for foreign cards, only Visa and Mastercard are accepted). We may arrange if you only have (sufficient amount of) cash (euros) so that you do not wait for 1 week to get the room.

The housing insurance can be obtained immediately when opening a bank account - see above.

*IMPORTANT*: Since all this process will take time, you must consider booking a hotel room for one day if you do not arrive in the morning, or more if you arrive during weekend or if you cannot pay directly to Crous either by credit card or by cash). The cheapest hotel in Sophia (500m from "Les Dolines" residence) is:

http://www.etaphotel.com/gb/booking/room-dates.shtml

(We do not help you for hotel booking.)

*IN A NUTSHELL:*

As mentionned, PROVIDED THAT you have foreign Visa or Mastercard credit/debit card, or enough cash when you arrive, so as to be able to pay 714.30 euros to get your room (=1st month rent +deposit), then you can first go to the bank to open your French bank account, subscribe the housing insurance, and go to Les Dolines (with me if you do not have such credit card). Please bring with you the acceptance letter you got from the master head, as well as the "Attestation of residency" signed by the director of Polytech, that you must have received along the acceptance letter. Please bring with you the new version I am sending you by September 20 where it is mentionned that you are hosted at Crous.

All this process may take 1 day, but can be done ONLY between Monday and Friday.
So in order to stay as less as possible at a hotel, it is important that you arrive during week days. (I will not be able to help you in case of problem during weekends.)

The opening hours of the bank are mentionned above. At les Dolines, you can get your room only between 8.30am-12.30am and 1.30pm-4pm.


The room at Crous is furnished with a bed, a table/ desk, chair, a closet, an equipped bathroom (with WC and shower), 2 electric stoves+a sink+a fridge.
Linen is not provided, you will need bed sheets (90cmx2m) and towels.

At the residence Les Dolines, you are required to provide:

* a copy of your ID (passport)
* a copy of your acceptance letter to the Master
* a proof of housing insurance
* a proof of liability insurance
* the payment mentionned above

###Crous vs CIV: Crous will be the residence of all 2011-2012 M1Int students

There is no possibility for housing at CIV the coming year. We actually put CIV as an exemple of residence, so basically you have answered yes to get an on-campus housing, not specifically CIV (at the time we have asked you whether you would like us to provide housing, we did not know what residence was available). We put CIV at first because you needed the name of a residence to get your visa.

CIV is one of the on-campus furnished residence, CROUS is another on-campus furnished residence, cheaper with private bathroom and private kitchen (contrary to CIV): CIV offers you a room, Crous offers you a studio apartment. Both are are on-campus (in Sophia Antipolis, where you will attend the courses). CIV includes food, Crous does not, but the cost of rent (350 before CAF)+food at Crous will be equivalent to the total cost at CIV (400 w/o lunch). There is a cafeteria on the campus where you can have lunch. You will have your small kitchen in the studio for the evening, and supermarket nearby.

<h3 id="the-procedure-translation-of-the-above-website">The procedure (translation of the above website):</h3>

<p>The French authorities have issued you with a long stay visa which allows you to remain in France subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must ensure that the French border police have stamped your passport with the date of your arrival in France. If you arrived in France via another Schengen state, the border authorities of that state must stamp your passport. In this circumstance, you will be considered to have arrived in France no later than 5 days after the stamp date</li>
  <li>Once in France, you must fill in the ‘OFII Certificate Request’ form (‘demande d’attestation OFII’) that you can find <a href="http://www.ofii.fr/IMG/pdf/formulaire_demande_d_attestation_OFII_recto-verso_FRA_modif_OFII_8_fev_2011_docm.pdf">here</a> which was sent to you with your visa, indicating the date of your arrival in France, your address in France, and the number of the visa you have been issued with so that the OFII can contact you to organise a medical examination, an arrival interview or an appointment to certify your presence.</li>
  <li>As soon as you arrive in France, you must send this form by registered mail (‘envoi recommandé avec accusé de réception’) to the local OFII office for your place of residence.</li>
  <li>You must include copies of the following items with your submission: personal information passport page, arrival stamp passport page, long stay visa</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be contacted by the OFII within three months of your arrival in France to arrange a health check and/or arrival interview. You will be required to provide the following items</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>a full face photograph (no head wear including veil)</li>
  <li>evidence of residence in France (either rent receipt; electricity/gas/water bill or fixed line telephone bill)</li>
  <li>Medical certificate, if you have had medical examination prior to arriving in France. Please refer to www.ofii.fr for further information</li>
  <li>OFII Fees – the amount you are required to pay can be found on http://www.ofii.fr/tests<em>197/quelle_est_la_procedure</em>1003.html</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these steps have been completed, your passport, stamped with the visa, and also containing written confirmation that all formalities have been successfully completed, you will be permitted to legally reside in France for the period specified by your visa.</p>

<p>If this procedure is not completed within three months, you may be subject to illegal residence procedures. During the final two months prior to the expiry of your visa, you may apply for a renewal of your authorisation to remain in France by applying for a residence card at your Prefecture. The staff there will provide you with the forms necessary and inform you of the necessary documentation, which may vary depending on the reason for your stay.</p>

<p>If you do not apply for renewal prior to the expiry of the visa, you will be obliged to go back to your home country and apply for a new visa.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-benefits-from-caf-and-other-administrations">Getting the benefits from CAF and other administrations</h3>

<p>CAF stands for Caisse d&rsquo;Allocations Familiales (https://www.caf.fr/wps/portal) and can provide you with financial support for housing.</p>

<p>You can be granted a benefit (usually directly given to Crous) of 100 to 150€ if you have a single room, 60€ each if you share a room. There are a lot of criteria taken into account for the computation of your benefit by this administration. We do not control it, but please be aware that, when filling in the form to apply, in order to get a full benefit, you must never define your scholarship as income or salary (« revenu » or « salaire ») but instead as a scholarship (« bourse »).</p>

<p>As soon as you get final response from OFII to be a legal alien for one year, then you can proceed with applying for this benefit:</p>
