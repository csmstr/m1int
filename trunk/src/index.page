# Master 1 International in Computer Science

The international track of the Master 1 in Computer Science is designed for international students. Lectures are given in English. French speaking students are welcome, provided they have a sufficient level in English.

The Master 1 program corresponds to the first year of the Master degree studies. Upon successful completion of this program, the student will be able to pursue in one of the several Master 2 programs offered by the [Master 2 IFI](http://www.polytech.unice.fr/informatique/page94.html) of the [University Nice-Sophia Antipolis (UNS)](http://www.unice.fr), [department of computer science](http://deptinfo.unice.fr/60_International%20Relationship.php).

The [Master 2 IFI](http://www.polytech.unice.fr/en/informatique/page93.html) offers several tracks in various fields of CS and IT (the details can be found [here](http://www.polytech.unice.fr/informatique/page94.html)). Among them, two international tracks are entirely taught in English: [Ubinet (Ubiquitous Networking and Computing)](http://ubinet.inria.fr/) and [CompBio (Computational Biology and Biomedicine)](http://cbb.unice.fr/public/web/presentation.shtml). <!-- Pursuing a second year in another university is also possible. -->

Students of [partner universities](http://moveonline.unice.fr/moveonline/exchanges/search.php) having an agreement with the [University Nice-Sophia Antipolis](http://www.unice.fr) are welcome and this track can also be validated in their country of origin.

<!-- The first year of the International Master in Computer Science is also designed for students wanting to have a minor in I&E (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), and in particular, for students who will register in the master school of [EIT ICT Labs](http://eit.ictlabs.eu/).
