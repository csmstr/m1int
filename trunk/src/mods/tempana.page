## Formalism For Temporal & Functional Analysis
<hr />
<br />

### Instructor(s)

[Robert de Simone](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Robert.De_Simone/)

### Description

* 3 ECTS

The goal of the course is to consider how formal models can be used to support engineering design of embedded and distributed systems, bridging the gap between theory and practice. We shall cover Models of Computation and Communications, process algebras and process networks, in relation to their UML/SysML engineering counterparts. We will introduce property- and model-checking, again in relation to requirement engineering and functional validation. Finally we will consider logical time, and the enforcement of time requirements by scheduling analysis.

Evaluation will consist in part of a final exam, in part of a project presentation based on the critical assertion of existing tools and methods (provided in the class).

### Prerequisites

* Notions of automata theory and elementary predicate logics
* Model-driven engineering (mostly UML)"

### Others

* Number of lectures (in hrs): 18
* Number of Exercise Classes (in hrs): 6
* Number of Labs Classes (in hrs): 6
