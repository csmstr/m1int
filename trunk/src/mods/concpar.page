## Concurrency and parallelism
<hr />
<br />

### Instructor(s)

TBA

### Description

* 4 ECTS

This course is an introduction to parallel and distributed programming.
We will study the parallelism from both a hardware and a software point
of view to highlight the tight coupling between them. We will also focus
on classical algorithms on a theoretical shared-memory model, the PRAM
machine, which provides a good framework for reasoning about
parallelism. Finally, we will focus on distributed memory systems
(clusters) and how to write efficient algorithms. The main example for
this part will be matrix product.

After this course, the students will be able to design efficient
parallel algorithm for symmetric multicore machines. They will also have
a good understanding of the message passing programming model. A third
of the course is dedicated to practical sessions where the students will
write parallel and distributed applications using the OpenMP and MPI
libraries.
