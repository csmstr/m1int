<h2 id="insurances">1.  Insurances</h2>

<h3 id="about-health-insurance">About health insurance?</h3>

<p>We strongly advise you to have a valid health insurance for the whole duration of your stay in France. It is of paramount importance. Below are the two cases depending on your age.</p>

<p>Students under 28 are required to take out French student medical insurance, referred to as &#8220;Sécurité Sociale&#8221;. This entitles the student to a reimbursement of up to 70 % of the standard price of medical expenses incurred. Prescriptions, eyeglasses and dental expenses are subject to different rates. Coverage is included into the university registration fee the student has to pay. 
LMDE is the public organization that manages student health insurance (it is a branch of &#8220;Sécurité sociale&#8221;.
A student can and should also take out a complementary health insurance policy which may reimbourse up to 100% of expenses incurred. More information <a href="http://www.lmde.com/special-inscriptions-2013-2014/etudiants-internationaux.html#c6226">here</a>.</p>

<p>Students who are 28 years old or over cannot subscribe a student social insurance along with the registration to the university. We advise you to subscribe a &#8220;Cover for foreign students&#8221; with LMDE for 12 months. All information and subscription procedure at:
http://www.lmde.com/etudiants-etrangers/couverture-sante-lmde.html#c6913
You can also choose a private health insurance such as <a href="http://www.assistance-etudiants.com/en/page/abc">here</a>.</p>

<p>Non-French EU-nationals are exempt from the above if they have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>

<h3 id="about-other-compulsory-insurances">About other compulsory insurances?</h3>

<p>Both insurances below are usually part of the insurance package (liability+housing insurance) that you subscribe at the time you are opening a french bank account. Below we describe the process to perform all this paperwork at once with Société Générale and LCL banks. Note that you are free to choose any other way to get the required insurance and bank account, but we provide help only with Société Générale and LCL.</p>

<h4 id="liability-insurance">Liability insurance</h4>
<p>You need to subscribe a liability insurance (&#8220;assurance responsabilité civile&#8221;). This is mandatory. In particular, the proof of liability insurance is requested at the beginning of the internship.</p>

<h4 id="housing-insurance">Housing insurance</h4>
<p>The housing insurance is required to check in your room (at Crous or any other place you have chosen). You can get the proof of housing insurance immediately, as soon as you suscribe it, whereas it will take about one week to get the checkbook and the credit/debit card.</p>

<p>So the first thing to do when you step out the airport is to go to the bank to subscribe these insurances additionally to opening your bank account.</p>

<h2 id="money">2. Money</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-money-should-we-have-when-arriving">How much money should we have when arriving?</h3>

<p>On your arrival, you will need money to pay the first rent plus the guarantee (that is 2 month rents) at the residence, the tuition fees and your general expenses. If you don&#8217;t have a visa or a mastercard to take money here, you will need at least approximately 2,000 euros in cash.</p>

<p>For those of you who are granted a scolarship, be aware that you will not cash the Labex scholarship immediately (usually one month after your arrival).</p>

<h3 id="in-order-to-open-a-bank-account-in-france">In order to open a bank account in France.</h3>

<p>At your arrival, you will need to open a bank account, immediately after getting out of the airport if you plan to get the insurance package mentioned above. The International Master 1 in Comuter Science of the University Nice Sophia has an agreement with the Société Générale, whose offices are in Sophia Antipolis. It will provide you personal banking services including credit card, cheque book, money transfer and more. (You can, of course, go to another bank if you prefer.)</p>

<p>For Société Générale, prior to your arrival, you need to schedule an appointment with them, before checking in at the residence to get your room (because the housing insurnance is requested to sign up the renting contract). To do so, send them an email mentioning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that you are student of the International Master in Computer Science (responsible is Mrs Sassatelli and Mr. Lopez),</li>
  <li>you want to open a bank account and subscribe a liability+housing insurance for 12 months,</li>
  <li>the student residence you will stay (and address),</li>
  <li>
    <p>a scanned copy of your passport (or write down in the email the corresponding fields: first and last names, citizenship, address, birth date, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>In Sophia Antipolis (Société Générale): info <a href="https://fc1.1bis.com/societegenerale3/?id=SGEN3000300508">here</a>.<br />
Check the opening hours and days. Send the email for the appointment to Mrs Desfarges (Sandrine.Desfarges&#8211;at&#8211;socgen.com) and Mr Boyer (Stephane.Boyer&#8211;at&#8211;socgen.com). In case you need the phone numbers: 04.92.96.54.49 or 04.92.96.54.46 or 04.92.96.54.44 or 04.92.96.54.43.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to bring to the bank:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport (or a valid ID),</li>
  <li>the acceptance letter to the master (sent by us),</li>
  <li>the proof of housing (sent by us)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-many-days-it-takes-to-open-a-bank-account-and-use-the-means-of-payment-such-as-credit-card">How many days it takes to open a bank account and use the means of payment such as credit card?</h3>

<p>At the bank, you immediately obtain your housing and liability insurances (to allow you to immediately sign up your renting contract and get the room), as well as the &#8220;RIB&#8221; (bank account details, including IBAN). However, you will need to wait for about one week to make some cash deposit on your new account and to obtain some means of payment such as checkbook and debit card.</p>

<h2 id="arrival">3. Arrival</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-manage-the-telephone-issue">How to manage the telephone issue?</h3>

<p>Bring an unblocked mobile phone to get easily a French phone number, which makes procedures easier and lets you save a lot of money.</p>

<h3 id="i-would-like-to-know-that-what-documents-should-i-get-translated-into-french-apart-from-my-birth-certificate-my-passport-and-my-all-transcripts-all-are-in-english-but-my-degree-certificate-is-in-bilingual-form-means-in-english-as-well-as-in-a-regional-language-so-is-it-necessary-to-get-translated-or-originals-in-english-are-enough">I would like to know that What documents should I get translated into French ?Apart from my Birth certificate. My Passport and my all transcripts all are in English but my degree certificate is in bilingual form (means in English as well as in a regional language) so is it necessary to get translated or originals in English are enough.</h3>

<p>The most important paper to be translated is your birth certificate. Apart from this document, it should be enough to have the diplomas and the transcripts in English.</p>

<p>In order to perform the administrative procedure described herein, you will have to bring the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Passport,</li>
  <li>The acceptance letter to the master,</li>
  <li>Copy of your CV,</li>
  <li>Copy of your visa, or carte de séjour or titre de séjour, and OFII Document that will be given from the
French Ambassy,</li>
  <li>Copy of your last university diploma or equivalent certificate (if it&#8217;s translated it would be better)</li>
  <li>Copy of your high school diploma (or equivalent certificate where it says the year you finished secondary
school)</li>
  <li>Copy of your birth document (french translated if possible)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need also the “Attestation provisoire d&#8217;inscription” which will be useful for your first procedures (including to
open your bank account). You can get these documents from Mrs Lilia Jemmali (phone:04 92 96 51 42,
email: jemmali@polytech.unice.fr office 438 at Polytech’Nice Sophia, les Templier, 930 Route des Colles -

<h3 id="could-anybody-tell-me-how-can-i-get-to-my-residency-when-i-arrive-at-nice-airport">Could anybody tell me how can I get to my residency when I arrive at Nice airport?</h3>

<p>Everything is explained here : http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Joanna.Moulierac/travelinformation.php</p>

<p>In this <a href="http://www.cg06.fr/fr/servir-les-habitants/deplacements/transport-collectifs-tam/lignes-et-horaires/lignes-et-horaires/">page</a> you have all the timetables for the TAM buses (which are the regional ones).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re coming on a working day, the 230 will take you from the airport to the door of the residence in less than one hour. Take into account that some of them pick passengers at terminal 1 and others at &#8220;airport promenade&#8221;; this stop is after crossing the Promenade des Anglais (the big avenue going along the airport) using a tunnel next to terminal 1. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101882952717510868710.000001134d95272f6f6eb&amp;ll=43.666344,7.211146&amp;spn=0,359.998258&amp;t=h&amp;z=20&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=43.666368,7.211347&amp;panoid=0n9QQSq9WPHD_uKDN_w2Vg&amp;cbp=12,278.97,,0,10.61">Here</a> you have a google map with all the stops and a close up on the airport promenade stop.</p>

<p>During the weekend, you need to take the bus number 200, asking for &#8220;correspondance&#8221; (that allows you to change buses), go down in &#8220;Passarelle SNCF&#8221; in the town called Antibes, cross the street and there you take the bus number 1 (Envibus company) and go down on the stop called &#8220;Georges Pompidou&#8221;. Warning: many of the buses don&#8217;t go to Sophia Antipolis, so you should ask the driver or look at the sign in the front. You need the ones that go to Gare Routière Valbonne Sophia-Antipolis (usually abbreviated as gare routiere VSA or such). The timetables for the number 1 are here: http://www.envibus.fr/ligne_detail.asp?id=1&amp;id_commune=10</p>

<h3 id="from-nice-to-sophia">From Nice to Sophia</h3>

<p>It is better to arrive to Nice on weekdays (Monday to Friday). By doing so, you can catch a bus that goes directly to Sophia Antipolis. This bus goes from the Nice Airport Terminal I (note that there is also Airport Terminal II) to Sophia Antipolis. The bus is the number 230, it costs only 1.5 euro. In 40 minutes you should be arriving to Sophia.</p>

<p>On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) or official holidays things will be more complicated. The right way to reach Sophia is going first to Antibes (Piscine bus stop) through bus number 200 (about 30 minutes) or by train (20 minutes). Then you go to Passarelle SNCF to take bus number 1 (Envibus) to Sophia (about 25 minutes). The bus 200 does not go directly through the Airport but it passes really close to it. You should leave the Airport towards Promenade Des Anglais, cross through the tunnel to go to the other side of the route, and then wait here for the bus 200 (still needs to be checked). Note that most buses do not work after 8.30pm. So if you were coming on the weekend it would be better for you to book an hotel in Nice.</p>

<h3 id="going-to-polytech">Going to Polytech</h3>

<p>If you live in Antibes, then you can use bus Ligne 100 Exp. (<a href="http://envibus.fr/">Envibus</a>) to go to Polytech. You can get a 1 year pass card for the Ligne 100 Exp. bus (company Envibus) by paying a low price (it is cheap, but you can use it only for Ligne 100 Exp.). </p>

<p>If you live in Nice, then you can use the bus 230 (cg06).
Remember: Try to avoid to arrive Sophia Antipolis in weekends because a lot of buses are not working on Saturdays and Sundays except few.</p>

<h3 id="tourism">Tourism</h3>

<p>Eurolignes: Has network all over the europe and prices are quite fair.
Easyjet: No brokerage fees and cheap offers.
SNCF : Only site to buy train tickets.
Eurail : If you want to travel all the Europe Eurail is the best options. they have very nice offers and passes. So just select the passes and travel at very cheap prices.</p>

<p>Nice (bus cg06 230), Antibes (bus envibus 1, 100), Cannes (bus cg06 200, 630), Monaco (bus cg06 100), Menton (bus cg06 100), Grasse (bus 530), Isola 2000 (bus cg06 750)</p>

<h2 id="housing">5. Housing</h2>

<p>For 2013-2014 scholar year, the Master can only help you for the reservation of a room at the CIV student residence. <a href="http://www.civfrance.com/centre/actualites">CIV http://www.civfrance.com/centre/actualites)</a> is located in 190 Rue Frédéric Mistral, Valbonne, France.</p>

<p>The price of the room at CIV is around 430 euros/month. It includes half board (breakfast and dinner) during the working days and full board during the weekend (breakfast, lunch and dinner). Moreover, the first time, you will pay around 860 euros, which will include your first rental payment + your rental guarantee.</p>

<p>Please, be aware that we don&#8217;t know how other university residences work, so we will not help you for any other housing solution you may choose.</p>

<!--Otherwise, you can find another solution, with for example the private residence Oxford, Thesa, Saint Exupery or other: http://www.sophia.ensmp.fr/cadre/logements.html . However, please note that we will not help you for any other housing solution you may choose.

There is also possibilities with colocation : www.colocation.fr/ or www.appartager.com/

Or private flats here : www.seloger.fr-->

<h3 id="is-there-a-possibility-for-financial-housing-support">Is there a possibility for financial housing support?</h3>

<p>As soon as you get final response from OFII to be a legal alien for one year, then you can proceed with applying for a benefit (so-called &#8220;Aide Pour le Logement&#8221; - APL). You should get 100 to 150 euros per month if you have a single room, or 60 euros each if you share a room. Please see the bottom of the FAQ.</p>

<h2 id="shopping">6. Shopping</h2>

<p>There is a Carrefour in Antibes that has good prices. To get there catch the bus 100 (Envibus) to bus stop Castors(I). Then walk. The way back is also catching the bus stop Castors(II).
In Nice you can buy from Lydl. Else Casino is also another option to buy.</p>

<p>There are two Asian shops in Antibes (one is near the BNP Paribas bank) where you can buy Asian food. You catch the bus 100 to Place De Gaulle, then walk.</p>

<h2 id="academic-aspects">7. Academic aspects</h2>

<h3 id="will-i-get-a-diploma-after-the-first-year-of-master-m1">Will I get a diploma after the first year of Master M1?</h3>

<p>NO. To get the diploma (degree) of master in France (and in Europe) you should have followed successfully the two years of master. After the first year you will get, if successful, 60ECTS (European credit Transfer system) which are necessary to apply for a second year in Sophia Antipolis or another place in Europe. To get a master in Europe you need 120 ECTS.</p>

<h3 id="is-the-master-m1--m2-considered-as-a-research-master-or-professional-master">Is the master (M1 + M2) considered as a research master&#8230; or professional master?</h3>

<h2 id="administrative-issues">8. Administrative issues</h2>

<h3 id="when-will-i-receive-the-letters-of-admission-from-the-university">When will I receive the letters of admission from the university?</h3>

<p>The letters will be prepared soon, you will receive them as soon as they are prepared by mail and to your postal address.</p>

<h3 id="for-the-visa-when-i-am-in-france-i-need-to-do-a-medical-check-at-ofii-where-is-it">For the VISA, when I am in France, I need to do a medical check at OFII. Where is it?</h3>

<p>To go to the OFII building (for medical checking) you have to get off at bus stop Santoline (in Nice). Note that not all buses 230 go through that bus stop, so check it before in the timetable, and remember to ask to the bus driver to stop there in advance (even if the bus is supposed to go through Santoline, when nobody asks for this bus stop the bus driver will take a different route, so better ask the bus driver as soon as you get on the bus). From Nice you can catch bus 10 also to go to prefecture.</p>

<h3 id="tuition-fees">Tuition Fees</h3>

<p>The French educational system allows all students to follow their studies with a low cost financial commitment. The cost of this program is based on regular French university fees. Tuition fees are approximately 490 Euros for the full year and cover course expenses and medical insurance for students below 28. Students above 28 must obtain a private health insurance.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-procedure-for-the-student-registration">What is the procedure for the student registration?</h3>

<p>During the first week of courses, a half day will be reserved by the university to register all the accepted students of the first year International Master in Computer Science.</p>

<!--    You will do your registration online: http://inscription.unice.fr/ as soon as the web site is available when you arrive.

    go on "Vous êtes étranger"
    click on "Autre cas  - Etudiants étranger admis en L3 en M1 ou M2 : Pour vous inscrire suivez ce lien"

    Then "D'accord, je souhaite déposer maintenant un dossier en Master 2 : Informatique : fondements & ingénierie"

    If you don't have a french diploma (for most of you), in "Personnes françaises ou étrangères titulaires de diplômes étrangers :" you will type "Numéro d'autorisation d'inscription = 9999" and the date of the day you register.
    The list of the students of the master Ubinet has been given to the registration office, so they are aware of the procedure.

    You will get by the end an appointment at office ANTENNE - 205 to complete the registration and get the student card. You will need to bring some papers there.

  <li>Once in France, you must fill in the ‘OFII Certificate Request’ form (‘demande d’attestation OFII’) that you can find <a href="http://www.ofii.fr/IMG/pdf/formulaire_demande_d_attestation_OFII_recto-verso_FRA_modif_OFII_8_fev_2011_docm.pdf">here</a> which was sent to you with your visa, indicating the date of your arrival in France, your address in France, and the number of the visa you have been issued with so that the OFII can contact you to organise a medical examination, an arrival interview or an appointment to certify your presence.</li>
  <li>As soon as you arrive in France, you must send this form by registered mail (‘envoi recommandé avec accusé de réception’) to the local OFII office for your place of residence.</li>
  <li>You must include copies of the following items with your submission: personal information passport page, arrival stamp passport page, long stay visa</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be contacted by the OFII within three months of your arrival in France to arrange a health check and/or arrival interview. You will be required to provide the following items</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>a full face photograph (no head wear including veil)</li>
  <li>evidence of residence in France (either rent receipt; electricity/gas/water bill or fixed line telephone bill)</li>
  <li>Medical certificate, if you have had medical examination prior to arriving in France. Please refer to www.ofii.fr for further information</li>
  <li>OFII Fees – the amount you are required to pay can be found on http://www.ofii.fr/tests<em>197/quelle_est_la_procedure</em>1003.html</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these steps have been completed, your passport, stamped with the visa, and also containing written confirmation that all formalities have been successfully completed, you will be permitted to legally reside in France for the period specified by your visa.</p>

<p>If this procedure is not completed within three months, you may be subject to illegal residence procedures. During the final two months prior to the expiry of your visa, you may apply for a renewal of your authorisation to remain in France by applying for a residence card at your Prefecture. The staff there will provide you with the forms necessary and inform you of the necessary documentation, which may vary depending on the reason for your stay.</p>

<p>If you do not apply for renewal prior to the expiry of the visa, you will be obliged to go back to your home country and apply for a new visa.</p>

<p>CAF stands for Caisse d&#8217;Allocations Familiales (https://www.caf.fr/wps/portal) and can provide you with financial support for housing.</p>

<p>You can be granted a benefit (usually directly given to Crous) of 100 to 150€ if you have a single room, 60€ each if you share a room. There are a lot of criteria taken into account for the computation of your benefit by this administration. We do not control it, but please be aware that, when filling in the form to apply, in order to get a full benefit, you must never define your scholarship as income or salary (« revenu » or « salaire ») but instead as a scholarship (« bourse »).</p>

<p>As soon as you get final response from OFII to be a legal alien for one year, then you can proceed with applying for this benefit:</p>
