# Master 1 International in Computer Science

The international track of the Master 1 in Computer Science is designed for international students. The lectures are all in English. French speaking students are welcome, provided they have a sufficient level in English.

The Master 1 program corresponds to the first year of Master studies, and upon successful completion of this program, the student will be awarded a degree called Master 1. This degree will allow students to apply either to the second year of the Master IFI of the [University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (UNS)](http://www.unice.fr) or to a second year in another University.

The Master 2 IFI offers a lot of tracks in various fields of IT and, in particular, an international track in English called [Ubinet (Ubiquitous Networking and Computing)](http://ubinet.inria.fr/).

Students of Partner Universities having an agreement with the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis are welcomed and this track can also be validated in their country of origin.

This Master 1 International program in Computer Science is also designed for students wanting to have a minor in I&E (innovation and Entrepreneurship), and in particular, for students who will register in the master school of [EIT ICT Labs](http://eit.ictlabs.eu/).
