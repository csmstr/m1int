### Description

* 2 ECTS

This course aims at introducing the basics of probability and statistical theory with illustrations in the fields of scientific analysis, computer system performance evaluation and image processing.

The first part of the course will be devoted to introducing/refreshing the notions of probability and probability distributions, random variables, random processes and limit theorems. Basic notions of statistics will also be covered including data-set analysis, comparison and determining which distribution fits a specific sample. Furthermore, the theory of estimation and hypothesis testing will be introduced and will be studied via an applicative example from image processing.

In the last part of the course, the design of experimental simulations and statistical quality control will be studied. Overall, the course will be taught with a balance between theoretical fundamentals and applicative illustration and will contain several exercise sessions and labs.
