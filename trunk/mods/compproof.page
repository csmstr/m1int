## Computer Assisted Proofs

### Instructor(s)

[Yves Bertot](http://www.inria.fr/sophia/members/Yves.Bertot/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

In this course we show how algorithms and proofs can be described using the Coq system. Lectures are organized as follows:

   1. Basic programming using lists and natural numbers
   2. Basic reasoning on logical connectives
   3. Reasoning on functions and algorithms
   4. Arbitrary data-types: a general approach to induction
   5. Advanced techniques for proofs by induction

Each lecture will come with a lab session and an assignment to be done at home.

At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to describe a general purpose recursive algorithm for basic needs in computer science (sorting data, storing and searching, efficient arithmetic computation, parsing, compiling).

### Prerequisites

Students should have a basic knowledge in programming in a conventional programming language, especially with a good understanding of recursivity.   Knowledge of functional programming is a plus, but not required.

Students should also master logic at a basic level.

### Others

* Number of lectures (in hrs): 9
* Number of Lab Classes (in hrs): 12
