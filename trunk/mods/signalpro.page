### Description

* 2 ECTS

The main objective of the Signal Processing course is to introduce basic concepts signal processing (Fourier, z-transform) and their applications in networks.  As such, the course also introduce the fundamentals of digital communications and give a quick overview of the main physical layers of wireless systems.

Matlab and/or Scilab will be used as a working tool to acquire the fundamental notions.

Assessment will be done partly by a final exam and partly by a project (homework) in matlab.

### Prerequisites

Basic mathematics should suffice  (including complex number theory, fundamentals of probability, ...)

### Others

* Number of lectures (in hrs): 10.5
* Number of Exercise Classes (in hrs): 10.5
