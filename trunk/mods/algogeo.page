### Instructor(s)

[Olivier DEVILLERS](http://www.inria.fr/sophia/members/Olivier.Devillers/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

This course provide an introduction to computational geometry problems: convex hull, Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram and arrangements. Main techniques are illustrated on these problems.

The proposed algorithms are analysed from a classical theoretical point of view and also form a more practical one in relation with actual implementation.

### Prerequisites

Background in  analysis of algorithms (sorting algorithms, O(n log n) analysis of merge sort, Omega(n log n) lower bound for sorting; binary search trees.

### Others

* Number of lectures (in hrs): 9
* Number of Exercise Classes (in hrs): 12
