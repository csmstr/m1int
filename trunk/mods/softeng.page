### Instructor(s)

[Philippe Collet](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~collet/)

### Description

* 2 ECTS

The aim of this course is to introduce and to use various software engineering techniques, with a focus on object-oriented and component-oriented approaches.

After an introduction to principles and tools of automatic building and execution, techniques on testing and profiling object-oriented sofware are presented. Mechanisms of introspection, reflexivity and dynamic loading are also studied. Issues about the forms and limits of different OO mechanisms (inheritance, composition, constrained genericity) are then illustrated. These studies lead to the introduction of micro-architectures, with the description and use of several design patterns. The first principles of software architecture are finally studiedn by introduction a component model and the basics of dependency injection.

### Prerequisites

Good knowledge of OO programming (Java preferred)

### Others

* Number of lectures (in hrs): 16
* Number of Lab Classes (in hrs): 24
